This is the development version of the R package "VimCom".
To download and build it do the following in a terminal emulator:

git clone git://github.com/jalvesaq/VimCom.git
R CMD build VimCom
R CMD INSTALL vimcom.plus_0.9-91.tar.gz
# If you want to check the package:
R CMD check vimcom.plus_0.9-91.tar.gz

However, note that you only need the version of VimCom available in the
github repository if you are using the development version of Vim-R-plugin,
which is available at https://github.com/jcfaria/Vim-R-plugin .
