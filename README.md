This is the development version of the R package "VimCom".
The easiest way to install it is to use the [devtools] package.

```s
library(devtools)
install_github('jalvesaq/VimCom')
```

However, note that you only need the version of VimCom available in the
github repository if you are using the development version of Vim-R-plugin,
which is available at https://github.com/jcfaria/Vim-R-plugin.
